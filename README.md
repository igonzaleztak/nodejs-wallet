# Client Wallet
This component is a WEB server that customers can use to buy measurements available in the platform in an intuitive and easy way. Here, customers can browse the available measurements, purchase them and see their value.

The server is connected directly to one of the nodes of the Blockchain, so customers can see at any time what is going on in the Blockchain. They can inspect the value of the blocks, transactions, etc.

The server is programmed using the `express` library of nodejs. The webpages are rendered dinamically using the technology `ejs`.
